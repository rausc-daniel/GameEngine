# Custom Game Engine

This is a little project where I like to implement different aspects of Game Engines from scratch to better understand the technologies and concepts that drive them. The focus is not on performance or beauty but much rather on knowledge gain and learning to effectively use C++ and its many opportunities.

It uses GLFW and GLEW to wrap OpenGL so that I can focus on the Game Engine Parts while still learning enough OpenGL without it becomming the focus of this project due to its verbosity and complexity.

LibPNG is used to load image files because it seemed to  be the most straight forward solution at the time.

## Features

* 3D rendering of quads and triangles
* Vertex and fragment shader file support (GLSL)
* Movement and Camera
* Extensible and generic

## Next steps

* FBX/OBJ support
* Geometry shader support
* AABB and more advanced collision
